# Good Practice: INSPIRE download services based on OGC API - Features

This repository contains a proposal for a specification for setting up INSPIRE download services based on the new [OGC API - Features standard](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features).

A [draft specification document](/spec/oapif-inspire-download.md) has been developed by experts from DK, FI and JRC. It will be submitted for review and testing to experts in the INSPIRE maintenance and implementation expert group (MIG) as well as solution providers who are already providing implementations of the standard. 

The ultimate goal of this activity is to submit the specification as an [INSPIRE good pratice document](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/portfolio/good-practice-library) to the INSPIRE MIG for endorsement. 

We therefore encourage INSPIRE implementers and solution providers to test the specification and to provide feedback on the feasibility, existing implementation plans and any issues encountered in this repository through the issue tracker.
